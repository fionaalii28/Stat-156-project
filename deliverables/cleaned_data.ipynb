Maternal presence has a mean and median of 1.0 with zero variance, and values range from 1 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "The table describes a sample of elementary and early middle school children for whom exact grade alignment is relatively uncommon, as only about ten percent of children are exactly on grade for their age. Age and grade attainment are tightly clustered around expected schooling levels, while demographic characteristics such as race and Hispanic status exhibit meaningful variation. Maternal education shows substantial dispersion, indicating socioeconomic heterogeneity in family background, while maternal presence is universal due to sample construction rather than reflecting population-wide household structure. Overall, the distributions align closely with the paper’s framing that educational progress in 1980 is uneven, socially stratified, and shaped by both demographic and family characteristics. Because Table 4 focues on demographic coverage rates and gfa, the statistical summary is only half of the table. The other half includes the coverage rates, which recreation-wise, needs to include the replication package given by the authors."

    "Average grade-for-age varies modestly across states, ranging from approximately 0.091 in the lowest-ranked state to approximately 0.114 in the highest-ranked state. Most states cluster closely around the overall mean of roughly 0.10, with differences across states generally within a few percentage points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "There is meaningful but limited geographic variation in grade-for-age outcomes across states. The relatively narrow range suggests that while location matters for educational progress, state-level differences are not large enough to dominate individual- or family-level factors, supporting the use of geographic fixed effects in the main regression analysis."
